# Exploring US Accident Data

We would like to look at vehicle accident data from February 2016 to December 2019 and cross-reference that with appropriate Census Data.

Ideas:
1. Evaluating numbers of accidents on major national holidays
2. Population density vs. location of accidents (at state level)
3. Rank states and number of accidents per capita
4. Number of accidents in Ohio based on weather conditions (light rain, snow, etc.)
